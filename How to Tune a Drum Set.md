# How to Tune a Drum Set




# Introduction

Whether you have just purchased your first drum set, or have had one for years, tuning is an amazing skill all drummers should have in their repertoire. By utilizing proper tuning methods, you can completely change the sound of your drum set with ease. No prior experience required.




# Materials

- A drum key
- Drums (Bass, Snare, Tom-toms)
--Included with drums: tension rods, two metal rings
- Drum heads (Two for each drum)
--Note: These come with your set, but it is recommended to buy better ones.
- (Optional) A tuning device, like a Drum Dial. Helps with finding exact tension values.


# Steps

### 1. Preparing to Tune
##### Note: If drum heads are not on drum, skip this step
- Use the drum key to loosen all tension rods on both sides of the drum, until loose enough to be moved by hand.
- This allows the tuning process to start from scratch.

### 2. Preparing the Resonant (Bottom) Head
- Place drum head onto bottom of drum frame, cover with metal ring, and hand tighten the tension rods until loosely secured in place.
-- To find the bottom side of the drum, look for a company logo on the outer shell. If facing upside down, that is the bottom side.

### 3. Time to Tune
##### Note: See Included Image
- Using the drum key and following the image below, tighten each tension rod a quarter turn.
- Repeat this step until each rod is secured tightly in place, but do not overtighten.

### 4. Testing for Equal Tension
- About an inch inward from the tension rod, tap the drum head and listen to the resulting sound.
- Repeat this at every tension rod in the order of tightening, and make sure the sound is the same.
-- If the sound is uneven at a certain point, loosen or tighten that tension rod and continue testing until all are equal.

### 5. Preparing the Batter (Top) Head
- Install the batter head in similar fashion to the resonant one, by placing the metal ring over the drum head and hand-tightening the tension rods until loosely secured in place.

### 6. Back to Tuning
- Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until batter head is secured in place and tension is even.

### 7. Check Your Work
- Now that you have successfully put together your drum, it can be adjusted to your liking. But for now, test how it sounds! These next few steps will go through how to change the way it sounds. If it sounds good to you already, then skip to Step 10.

### 8. Fine Tuning of the Batter Head
##### Note: Continue following the pattern in the image from Step 3 for loosening/tightening.
- The batter head is responsible for the way the drum rings.
-- If you want your drum to be more punchy, slightly tighten all of the tension rods until it rings less.
--On the other hand, if you want a more ringy sound, loosen all of the tension rods until the sound sustains more.

### 9. Fine Tuning of the Resonant Head
##### Note: This is personal preference! Test it and see what you like.
- This step requires some thought, as it is dependent off of Step 8.
- There are three options:
1. Resonant head looser than batter head.
2. Resonant head same tension as batter head.
3. Resonant head tighter than batter head.
- Options 1 and 3, simply put, will make the sound of the drum shorter and less ringy.
- Option 2 will make the drum sound much more lively, and the sound will last longer.

### 10. The Rest of the Kit
- Repeat Steps 2-9 for the remaining drums in your set.

### 11. Test Your Work
- This process can be time consuming; be proud of what you did!
- Mess around, play some songs, and see if everything sounds the way you want it to.
- If something sounds slightly off, you now know how to fix it!
